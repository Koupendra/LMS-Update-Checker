# LMS-Update-Checker

What Is This?
-------------

This is a Python application that gives a notification if any of the courses you enrolled in LMS has got updates.


How To Use This?
----------------

1. Download the project.
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies inside the project folder.
3. Run `setup.py` and complete the setup.
4. Run `main.py` (which is the acutal application).
5. You can start and run this application at particular time intervals by configuring your Task Scheduler.


NOTE
----

1. The `Details.txt` will contain your credentials for LMS, so make sure it's inaccessible by others.
2. The project is still in development, so it will have bugs.
3. This will work only on Windows 10 as of now (I will try to extend it for Linux in future).
4. Turn off "Focus Assist" to receive notifications.
